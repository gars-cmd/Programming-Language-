"First-order", "higher-order", and "first-class" are terms that describe the treatment of functions in a programming language.

- **First-order** functions are functions that take only values as input and produce values as output. They don't accept functions as arguments or return functions as output.

- **Higher-order** functions are functions that can either take functions as arguments or return functions as output or both.

- **First-class** functions are functions that can be used in the same way as values. They can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to functions, and returned as values from functions.

A programming language that supports first-class functions is considered to be a higher-order programming language.

Static typing and dynamic typing are two ways of defining the type of a variable in a programming language.

**Static typing** means that the type of a variable is defined at compile time and cannot change during the execution of a program. This means that if a variable is declared as an int, for example, it will always be an int and cannot be changed to another type like a string. Languages such as C, Java, and Haskell use static typing.

**Dynamic typing**, on the other hand, means that the type of a variable is determined at runtime and can change during the execution of a program. This means that if a variable is assigned a value of one type, it can later be reassigned a value of a different type. Languages such as Python, Ruby, and JavaScript use dynamic typing.

**Static typing** can help catch type errors at compile time, while **dynamic typing** can be more flexible and allow for quicker development. The choice of static vs dynamic
